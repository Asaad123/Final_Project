The analysis is done on the data provided by the PHENIX experiment at RHIC-BNL. The data is a run summary table, and it was obtained from 
this website: https://www.phenix.bnl.gov/experiment/runs.html. 

In order to perform the analysis on the data related to my PhD topic which is in Heavy Ion Collision domain, I've created a subtable containing 
only the data related to Au-Au collisions (Gold-Gold collisions). For the sake of doing some creative analysis, I ignored
the biased data of some Au-Au collosions compared to other collisions. On top of that, I've change the structure of the table and unified the
units used for each physical quantity. In conclusion, the process of comparing the original table with the table used in the analysis is highly 
non-trivial, keeping in mind that the essance of the data is the same.
